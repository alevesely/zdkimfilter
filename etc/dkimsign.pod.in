=head1 NAME

dkimsign - a wrapper around zdkimfilter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dkimsign> [I<option> [I<option-arg>] I<message-file> ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dkimsign> is a wrapper around the zdkimfilter executable.  It provides for
offline signing of messages, and a few other utilities.  It searches for the
zdkimfilter executable in the build-time configured path, and either in the
directory used for calling it, if any, or in the PATH.  That way it can work
when the package is built but not yet installed.

To have zdkimfilter sign the files, it writes a minimal ctlfile in the tmp
directory (either F</tmp> or the one given in the I<tmp> configuration option).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-f> I<config-filename>

Specify a different configuration file.  That way it is possible to configure
for signing different header fields, or using different keys.  B<dkimsign> only
reads the I<tmp> and I<default_domain> configuration options, but forwards this
command line option to the invoked zdkimfilter.

=item B<--syslog>

Log to syslog (LOG_MAIL facility) rather than stderr.


=item B<--no-db>

Pass the I<--no-db> option to zdkimfilter, so as to avoid having the
messages signed this way logged to the database.


=item B<--filter>

Use standard I/O, that is read a mail file on stdin and rewrite it to stdout.
This option implies I<--syslog>, but the filter response is echoed on stderr in
case of error.

I/O behavior is obtained by passing the I<--no-fork> option to zdkimfilter.
That way, the message-file arguments get silently ignored.

=item B<--domain> I<domain>

Use this as the signing domain.  The ctlfile will have
E<lt>postmaster@I<domain>E<gt> as the authenticated user.  This may or may not
result in a signature by such domain, according to the other configuration
options.  If the I<domain> argument contains a C<@>, only the part after it is
used.

=item B<--config>

Have zdkimfilter check and print the configuration file.

=item B<--help>

Print usage and exit.

=item B<--version>

Have zdkimfilter print the version.  B<dkimsign> just prints which executable
it is about to run.

=head1 FILES


=over

=item F<@COURIER_FILTER_INSTALL@/zdkimfilter>

head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES


=over

=item REMOTE_ADDR

If this variable is set, zdkimfilter uses it for database logs as the client's
C<ip> variable.
