# selector for all keys.
# Each key should be a softlink; the basename of the linked to file
# contains the selector. If the basename starts with the same string as the
# link, i.e. the domain name, then that initial part and an optional dot
# are skipped. E.g., the following will all result in assigning selector "s"
# to the key for "example.com":
#
#    example.com -> ../somewhere/example.com.s
#    example.com -> ../somewhere/example.coms
#    example.com -> ../somewhere/s
#    example.com -> /somewhere/else/example.com.s
#    example.com -> /somewhere/else/example.coms
#    example.com -> /somewhere/else/s
#    example.com -> example.com.s
#    example.com -> example.coms
#    example.com -> s
#
# If a selector name cannot be determined that way, then the selector specified
# here, if any, or the constant "s" will be used.

# temporary directory. libopendkim uses /var/tmp by default.
# if you specify a value of /tmp/xyz, zdkimfilter attempts mkdir

# default_domain
# used if no domain can be inferred from authenticated user id

# no_spf
# if Courier set Received-SPF: pass for sender or helo, report that in A-R
# unless no_spf is set
# no_spf

# add_a_r_anyway
# Add an A-R field also if no signature or other A-R had been found

# check_domain
# Check the "author" domain (determined by the OpenDKIM library using the most
# significant header field among "From", "Reply-To", etc.) exists.
# If NXDOMAIN, reject the message. If the domain publishes an ADSP policy
# that states that any message from them can be discarded if it doesn't have
# a valid author domain signature, the message is also rejected.
# If the policy just says they sign all messages, the message is accepted and
# the result reported in A-R for method "x-dkim-adsp".

# check_reputation
# make a query to get the reputation of the signer. The result is reported in
# A-R for method "x-dkim-rep" according to the two values specified next

# reputation_fail
# any values greater or equal than this are reported as "fail"

# reputation_pass
# any values less or equal to this are reported as "pass"
# values V in between, reputation_fail < V < reputation_pass, are reported
# as "neutral".
