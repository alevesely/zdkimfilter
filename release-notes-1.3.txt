Config file changes:
===================

Added parameter verify_one_domain.  In 1.2, unless report_all_sigs is enabled,
only the first domain gets verified.  In 1.3, verifying is tried for each
signing domain in the same situation, unless the new parameter is enabled.

Added parameter add_ztags, to add z= in the signature, for debugging.


Database changes:
================
The example was wrong, as a domain can send multiple messages simultaneously
(that is, handled by parallel zdkimfilter processes).  This lead to log lines
like:
 * part #1 of query db_sql_whitelisted had 2 rows, or
 * DB error: Result consisted of more than one row.

It can be fixed by changing the index to unique.

   ALTER TABLE domain DROP INDEX by_dom, ADD UNIQUE INDEX by_dom(domain);

To avoid losing old domain data, one can create a new table and rename it:

   CREATE TABLE new_domain (...);

   INSERT INTO new_domain
   SELECT MIN(id), domain, SUM(recv) AS recv, SUM(sent) AS sent,
      MAX(whitelisted) AS whitelisted,
      MIN(since) AS since, MAX(last) AS last
   FROM domain
   GROUP BY domain;

   RENAME TABLE domain TO old_domain, new_domain TO domain;
   DROP TABLE old_domain;

In either case, replace procedure recv_from_domain.


Bug fixes and other changes:
===========================
Domains with non-alnum chars (hyphen) didn't work --thanks to Ilmar Kruis.

'author' and similar flags were set in messages even if DKIM signature failed.

Drop log line (verbose>=1) changed from dropped,From-MTA=... to drop msg,id=...
at LOG_INFO (was LOG_ERR).  Other logging cleaned up a bit (see ChangeLog).
